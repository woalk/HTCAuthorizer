###Formerly *HTC Authorizer*
##Xposed Module [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/woalk/HTCAuthorizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/woalk/HTCAuthorizer)
This [Xposed Module](http://repo.xposed.info/) removes the message

!["Unauthorized device - This app is not compatible with your phone."](http://ext.woalk.de/img/github/htcblinkfeedunauth.png)

from [HTC BlinkFeed/Sense Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.htc.launcher&hl=en) and other HTC apps.

Also, it integrates some Sense features into pure AOSP ROMs!

###Requirements
This app requires Android 5 or 5.1 Lollipop and the **correct** Xposed Framework
for [5.0](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811)
or [5.1](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3072979).

Furthermore, this requires obviously HTC Sense (7) apps and HTC Service Pack.
It should work on any ROM. HTC apps do not need to be installed as system apps.

However, for some features, an AOSP ROM is needed.

###Version
The currently supported BlinkFeed/Sense Home version is
**`7.12.563037`**.

The current BlinkFeed/Sense Home plug-ins supported:
- Facebook for HTC Sense
- Twitter for HTC Sense
- Google+ for HTC Sense
- LinkedIn for HTC Sense
- Instagram for HTC Sense
All of them in their currently newest version (`7.00.4xxxxx`/`7.00.5xxxxx`).

Other Sense apps currently supported:
- Camera: Allow saving to external storage.
- Gallery: Allow accessing/modifying different storages.
- Themes: Use HTC Themes to theme your AOSP system!
- IME: Use the newest version of the Sense Keyboard.

###Download
You can download this module from either the GitHub release page (see on top of the page -> Releases),
or the official [Xposed Repo page](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.woalk.apps.xposed.htcblinkfeedauthorizer).
I recommend the last one, it is the best integrated way of installing an Xposed Module.
(Also I can count downloads.)
